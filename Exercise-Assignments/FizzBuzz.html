//step by step explained!
a 'for' loop is created with the intend to loop a task multiple times. In our case we asked it to do so 9 times the loop {0 till 9th time is reached because 9 < 10} 
{i++ will run it after each execution in the codeblock has finished, incremented by 1} 
{After the FOR (loop) we open and close the curly braces: Anything in between this will be run through step by step}
the 'if' (first & start & opening condition) sets the bar by telling the computer to take the (Mentor his good example) first car it sees and drive it off out the driveway. {Now we can tell the computer to print to the console with the words 'console.log' or let it print in space without output by using the phrase 'return'}
the 'else if' (meaning if the first and above condition is not met we will initiate this one) {
	in here it will follow the instruction given to it like print with 'console.log' or space it with the phrase 'return' 
} 
the 'else if' could be used endlessly ***just a sidenote :)
the 'else' (is the last & closing & final condition) This way we will tell it to execute to print 'return' or 'console.log'
the console.log(i) is the numbers it will print if none of the conditioned as described above is met, meaning if none of the aforementioned once is worth it then print out the meaning / value of (i) 

for (var i = 00/1/3000orwhatever; i(we gave a value 00/1/30000orwhatever) </>/=/<=/>= till the number it should run to, thus does not include this number;) this is the loop it does inside the {codeblock} until it reached the last condition.
